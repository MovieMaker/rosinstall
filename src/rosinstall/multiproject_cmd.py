## The _cmd python files attempt to provide a reasonably
## complete level of abstraction to multiproject functionality.
## 
## Client code will need to pass the Config element through,
## and may use the ConfigElement API in places.
## There are no guarantees at this time for the API to
## remain stable, but the cmd API probably will change least.
## A change to expect is abstraction of user interaction.
